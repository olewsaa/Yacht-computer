# Interfacing to CANbus / NMEA2000

Interfacing CANbus (Controller Area Network) or NMEA2000 to
OpenPlotter allows you to integrate your marine navigation and
communication systems with your OpenPlotter setup. CANbus and NMEA2000
are both widely used communication protocols in the marine
industry. They enable devices like chartplotters, GPS receivers,
sensors, and other marine instruments to exchange data and work
together seamlessly.
