# Interfacing to CANbus / NMEA2000

## Introduction
Interfacing CANbus (Controller Area Network) or NMEA2000 to
OpenPlotter allows you to integrate your marine navigation and
communication systems with your OpenPlotter setup. CANbus and NMEA2000
are both widely used communication protocols in the marine
industry. They enable devices like chartplotters, GPS receivers,
sensors, and other marine instruments to exchange data and work
together seamlessly.

The CANable device is a popular USB-to-CAN adapter that allows you to
connect your computer to a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. It is a
compact and affordable device that provides a simple way to interface
with CAN networks for various applications, including automotive,
industrial, and marine systems.

The CANable device is based on the Microchip MCP2515 CAN controller
and MCP2551 CAN transceiver. It offers a USB interface for easy
connectivity to your computer and supports both CAN 2.0A (11-bit
identifier) and CAN 2.0B (29-bit identifier) protocols.

With the CANable device, you can integrate CAN bus functionality into
your OpenPlotter setup. By connecting the CANable adapter to your
Raspberry Pi running OpenPlotter, you can interface with CAN-enabled
marine devices, retrieve data from the network, and utilize it within
the OpenPlotter ecosystem. This enables you to access and process data
from instruments like chartplotters, engine monitors, sensors, and
more, enhancing your marine navigation, monitoring, and automation
capabilities.


## Using the Canable device

The [canable](https://canable.io/) can translate the CANbus messages and data to a serial Linux device. 
This device will manifest itself as a */dev/ttyACM0* (og 1,2 etc if many devices are connected). 

In openplotter dialog window this device could be selected, but that is nor always a good solution as the 
*ttyACMx* number can change. A far better option is to make a udev entry and give the canable device a 
proper name in the ```/dev/``` directory, my coice is 'canable'.

### Making a udev antry
The [udev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev) is a Linux subsystem
that manages the device nodes in the */dev* directory. It is
responsible for handling the dynamic creation and management of device
nodes as devices are connected or disconnected from the system. udev
allows for automatic device recognition and configuration, making it
easier to manage hardware devices in a Linux environment.

udev operates based on a set of rules defined in configuration
files. These rules match devices based on their attributes and provide
instructions on how to handle them.

To make a new udev entry one need to find the right numbers for the device,
assuming that the canable device came up as */dev/ttyACM0* :
```
udevadm info --query=all --name=/dev/ttyACM0 | grep ID_VENDOR_ID 
E: ID_VENDOR_ID=ad50
udevadm info --query=all --name=/dev/ttyACM0 | grep ID_MODEL_ID
E: ID_MODEL_ID=60c4
```
The numbers differ from the ones given on the canable [web page](https://canable.io/updater/udev.html).
If the pipe grep is omitted text identifying the device will be displayed, nice if *ttyACM0* is not 
the canable device.

The udev rules files are found at : */lib/udev/rules.d/* and the file *10-local-rpi.rules* is used for 
local rules. Append the line :
```
ATTRS{idVendor}=="ad50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="60c4", SYMLINK="canable%n"
```
to the */lib/udev/rules.d/10-local-rpi.rules* and run the command
```
udevadm trigger
```
if the Vendor and Product match the values found when the device report in you should now have
a new device in the dev directory, */dev/canablex* (x might be 0, 1, 2, I got */dev/canable1* and */dev/canable2*).
They are :
```
root@OpenPlotter:/lib/udev/rules.d# ls -l /dev/cana*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      7 juni   3 12:18 /dev/canable1 -> ttyACM1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     15 juni   3 12:18 /dev/canable2 -> bus/usb/001/004
```
One is a link to the USB port while the other is a link to the *ttyACM1* device. I use canable1 in 
Openplotter.

Now try a reboot and check if all devices and entries come up as expected and that all interfacing
with OpenPlotter work.
