# Scripts for my Xiegu G90

My Xiegu G90 is installed on board Algol. Both marine call sign LG3328
and my ham call sign LB4PJ.


## Dual frequency marine channels 

Some scripts to facilitate dual frequency marine channels as the
memory cannot set both A and B. 

You still need to swap A/B manually and run tune as the rigctld do not
support tune for flrig/G90.
