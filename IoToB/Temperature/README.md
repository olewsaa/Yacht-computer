# Temperature sensor 

## Computer system - ESP-8266

### 1-wire sensors 

I have used an ESP-12E NodeMCU 1.0, an ESP8266 board from China for
this project. The ESP8266 well suited for this task, 1-wire and wifi
which is all that's needed. The software development environment is
Arduino IDE which relies on the C (close enough) programming language.

### Use case - on board
The temperature sensor project has [webpages]
(https://sites.google.com/site/olewsaa/yacht-server-with-raspberry/temperature-monitoring)
about the project with overview and pictures of the hardware in
addition a description and ideas behind the setup.

### OpenPlotteer and SignalK 

The SignalK names selected should match the standard and what OpenPlotter recognise. 
These three are used for the current setup :
* propulsion.1.temperature
* environment.inside.engineRoom.temperature
* electrical.alternators.1.temperature.warnUpper 

Using these labels OpenPlotter can pick them up and trigger alarms if
any of these runs to high. OpenPlotter can also translate to NMEA
sentences for export to openCPN.

### Setup and implementation

![Breadboard](https://github.com/olewsaa/Yacht-computer/blob/master/img/Temperatures_bb.png 
"ESP-8266 breadboard layout")

The 1-wire sensors are powered by 3.3 Volt from the ESP-8266. There
should be a pull up resistor from +3.3V to the signal wire.  My setup
is a star topology which is not really in line with best practice. The
pullup resistor is lowered to 2.2k as the three cables introduce a lot
of capacitance and inductance. In addition to limit the impedance
misfit and reflection problems on the transmission line a serial
resistor of 100 ohms is inserted in each line. So far these measures have
worked and the system now seem to be stable.

In the box all 1-wire terminals are connected in parallel, but with
the serial resistor mentioned above, the power require two wires while
all the signals travels on a shared single bus wire, hence the name
1-wire. It's a very simple setup and extra sensors can easily be
added. Each sensor has a unique serial number so there is no
addressing issues.

### Experience

The box was placed inside the stairway obove the engine, but outside of the 
isolation. While not 70Â°C like inside the engine room, hot enough for the B1205 
converter to overheat. The box is now placed in the technical room with a junction
inside the machine room and a 3 wire cable run to the box.
